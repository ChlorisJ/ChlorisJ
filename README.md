👋 Thanks for stopping by! I'm Chloris. Welcome to my GitHub!

As a proud Class of ’22 UofT alum with an honors undergrad degree in applied statistics 📈 and neuroscience 🧠. I have always been passionate about becoming a driver to leverage creative problem-solving, combining with business intuition and advanced analytics to help organizations harness the power of data to make informed decisions. 

My current work as a Senior Business Analyst at CIBC 🏦 is mainly focused on business strategy design and deployment by developing advanced analytical techniques to optimize acquisition and credit performance. I enjoy solving problems that drives change, improves efficiency and are mind-boggling. In the past I’ve built data-heavy, insight driven analytical tools and influenced strategic decisioning.
